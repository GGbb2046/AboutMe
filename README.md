### **Projects**

1. **BG Module with credit - integration to customer masters - Owner
Oct 2018**

    _Project description_
    
    This project was really intuitive in a sense that it drove an understanding of the AR, the credit limits, the banking facilities availed by our customers. 
    We are doing business based on Bank Guarantees. We were having a manual excel sheet for tracking these. Plus these were not linked to customer masters and the accounts manager had to manually feed them in the system. However, that gave us trouble having a real time picture. Plus, there had been intermittent lags in sending out confirmation on extinguishing or maintaining these BGs. 

    We partnered with our Microsoft liaison - Tectura and developed a system that would be able to validate the credit limits at the time of creation of sales orders. We now have our masters for BG which is linked to customer masters reflecting the date of creation and expiration. An automatic mail trigger is sent now to the customer before 15 days of the BG expiry along with a cc to the Area sales manager.
    I take this opportunity to thank our accounts manager and sales director for their support in this endeavor.

2. **SOD Matrix deployment - Lead
Sep 2018 – Oct 2018**

    _Project description_

    SOD matrix roll out in concert with ITGC.

    We collaborated with the Asian markets in China, India, HKG, Cambodia and Singapore to draft an excel automated permission sets. We created an SQL dump of our access and permissions and aligned that with the standardized SOD. We also took help from our Indian counterparts at CIPL who lent us their version of SOD for which I am very thankful to them.

    All in all a solid collaboration of our Carlsberg Asian entities.


3.  **Project nameP2P standardization - ERP: Microsoft Dynamics Navision - Lead
Jun 2018 – Aug 2018**

    _Project description_
    
    Cross functional integration of the ERP software to accommodate the pay to procure standardization was one of the most challenging task, period. Not only we had to have the systems in place for the P2P, most of all, we needed to sell our idea to our colleagues across functional departments. We had leaders from Supply chain, logistics, administration, IT including sales team to internalize the idea and roll the framework in the system. 
    In the process, we the finance and IT deployed SQL reports to review everything was taking place in accord. 

    Moreover, we co-partnered with BU's across the Asian markets to gather intel and deploy the module in partnership with Tectura. I would say a great opportunity to comprehend the dynamics of the ERP system. 

    _Project Details:_
    
    - Deployment of Approver, maker and checker system at the Blanket PO's for BOM items, PRN for service and other purchases, PO, GRN and Invoice.
    - Alignment of the approval system and its validation against SOD matrix and the Chart of Authority.
    - Supply Chain - Procurement & Production integration in NAV along with Asset maintenance module


4. **Business Intelligence Tools - Cube Deployment - Project Member
Oct 2015 – Nov 2015**

    _Project description_
    
    Business Intelligence is key to any enterprise. We worked with Tectura to establish a data mart which was synced to the regional servers. This was then linked to the BI tool. We got connected to the tool using the Excel. However later we started using Power BI tools for in depth data analysis and review of trends in the operational departments.

5. **Implementation - Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013
May 2015 – Aug 2015**

    _Project description_
    
    When we migrated to the ERP system, we had the basic 2005 version of the Dynamics NAV. Moving from a FACT based accounting software, things were quite tricky and complex at times. However we managed to get along until 2013. 

    In the same year though, Microsoft changed the way dimension sets were handled through the database. They had their own table and now they could be better managed through reporting tools. Dimensions like cost center, brand, area, contact, machine now all appeared on a single table and it worked wonders when we tried to build reports on Visual Studio and Jet Reporting tools.

    The projected entailed the entire re -mapping of the dimensions along with introduction to master templates. Plus the security features got beefed up and the 2013 version now supported widgets and push notification on the interface. Alot of the feature was still customizable though.

    A thorough understanding of the ERP system is what we, the finance and IT team received. - Great learning

6. **Project nameChart of Accounts - IFRS standardization - lead
Sep 2013**

    _Project description_
    
    We had moved from an accounting software - FACT to a full-fledged ERP system in 2011. However, there had been issues with synchronizing the regional COA database with that of the local one. We had to map the COA in entirety as per IFRS also having the control ledgers reconciled with that of GL. Plus there had been local GAAP adjustment for which the standardized COA did not provide any specific GL's. We worked with the regional team at HK and developed few GL's for local GAAP adjustment. 

    Customer, Vendors, Banks, Inventory were all mapped and reconciled to their immediate master GL's. This project provided me a solid foundation on the operation of COA, its approval and validation from a control perspective. This was my first project when I joined Carlsberg.
